<h2><strong>Urchin barren</strong><br></h2>
People deny reality by the medium of dreams.<br>
Close your eyes and open them again, wouldn't it be a dream?<br>
It'd rather it was a dream.<br>
<h3>"I wish it was a dream."<br></h3>
<p style="margin-top:20px">The blind, which is likened to "reality",
 felt like a escape to hide the sun by blocking light.
 This reminds us of our efforts to avoid serious climate change(reality).
'Dream Text' appears only when blind people pass light.
Light means the reality that we have to face up to,
 and the artist acts as a subject that connects dreams and reality with ambivalence.</p>
